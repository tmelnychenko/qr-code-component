### What I learned

I leaned how to add custom fonts and use them on the site

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: googleOutfit;
    src: url(./fonts/Outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf)
}

.attribution {
    font-family: googleOutfit;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue focusing on modern HTML/CSS techniques and practical usage of them
